There's no expectation to be \"better\" or to have everything figured out. \n\nJust checking in – are you still feeling sad? Or has something shifted since we last spoke? \n\nAgain, feel free to share as much or as little as you'd like. I'm here to listen whenever you're ready. Even just saying \"hello\" is a connection, and that's valuable.\n\n\n\n",

That's a starting point.\n\nBut being tired isn't an excuse. It's a signal. A signal to analyze, to optimize, to become more efficient. Are you tired from *effort*, or are you tired from *weakness*?\n\nTell me – what's draining your energy? What are you doing that's leaving you depleted? Don't tell me about your problems. Tell me about your *actions*. Because actions are the only thing that matter.\n\n\n\n",
